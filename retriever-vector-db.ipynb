I have purchased this three times in the last three months.  I have also been purchasing these candles from you for about four or five years your price keeps going up; your quality keeps going down. You will lose your client base. The quality of your candles has consistently gotten worse. It is very obvious you are using the old fashion way of making your candles where theres a lot of wax around three little candles.  The last three candles I have purchased  have problems keeping the wicks lit. I just purchased a candle, and only one wick out of three works.  The candles was  $78  I do not have a problem, paying for a quality item.  Based on what I am seeing and on the number of purchases I have made which are quite a few. I consider this to be an insult to your customers.  If you were going to reduce your quality of your candles, reduce your price, I could make a better candle than the candle that I just recently purchased through Amazon, which is yours.  It is extremely upsetting to have a company like yours allow themself to reduce their quality to the point that it is right now. I hope other customers will reach out to you and make you aware of how unhappy they are with your low quality which has been since Covid.  If you cant make a quality candle, reduce your price at least by 2/3rd. These candles used to be worth the price, but the quality of your candles now, they are not worth the price.  Its better to buy your own vetiver, yes, it is expensive, and and make your own candles because then at least you know, your wicks will work and they wont be made cheaply the way that you are now making them. These are no longer high-quality candles. They are not worth the price. I am really sorry to say that because I have enjoyed these candles tremendously.  You have ruined your company. You have ruined your companys  reputation by your lack of caring about the quality and service you are providing your customers. I will also be submitting this on your website.  When I first started purchasing your candles, I gave you five stars. Youre down to one star if there was a possibility of doing zero stars that is exactly what I would give you.  Paying $78 for a candle that is a three wick candle and only one wick is works and you can obviously see there are three little candles just filled with wax around them unlike the way you used to make them.  Your customers are noticing the downward spiral. Your company is taking in quality. You will lose them.Read more24 people found this helpfulHelpfulReportEOS Decorating5.0 out of 5 starsBetter then the restReviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024Scent: CharcoalVerified PurchaseThis candle is absolutely AMAZING! I\\'ve had it for about a month and use it multiple times a week.I was stewing on this product for a long while but couldn\\'t justify the price. $80 for a candle just seems outrageous! Finally, I made the decision to purchase it here and figured at worst, I would return it. I\\'ve heard from others that the scent reminds them of a sexy man, and I must concur. It truly is an amazing smell and it covers smells from cooked food to smoke  to so on.I use this in my bedroom and only have to light it for 30 minutes to 1 hour and it completely fills up the room, enters the hallway, and master bath. I haven\\'t made a dent in the candle and I suspect it\\'ll last me 6 months or more!  For reference, the bedroom size is about 40 ft by 20 ft. In order for me to get this kind of throw I would have to light 2 to 3 candles for hours on end, speaking specifically about the most popular brands. Because of this purchase, I decided to purchase the advent calendar from their site in order to sample a lot of their other fragrances and found some gems.  Some other smells that are fantastic are Earl Grey Bitters and Hinoki Lavender in their candle and reed diffusers.Their products definitely costs more then any other company I\\'ve seen but the quality is second to none.  They\\'re legit when they talk about the amount of fragrance oils, quality of the candles base, vessel, and so on.  As I\\'m writing this review I\\'m subscribing to another scent,  Earl Grey Bitters in the large 3 wick candle. This size candle is one of their better values if you enjoy the scent.Read more2 people found this helpfulHelpfulReportmihaela birca2.0 out of 5 starsNot worth the priceReviewed in the United States on February 16, 2024Scent: White VetiverVerified PurchaseThe candle looks great and the packaging was nice, but almost no scent.

To my great surprise and disappointment, this \"luxury\" three-wick candle was missing all its wicks! What shoddy quality control for such a pricey candle.

The smell is fantastic. Just as good as some of my crazy expensive D-que candles. The wicks do burn a little dirtier than Id like (black soot pools in all white candle), but for the price and the quality/throw of fragrance I absolutely give 5 stars!Read more4 people found this helpfulHelpfulReportJanet1.0 out of 5 starsWhat happened to the quality of your candlesReviewed in the United States on June 23, 2023Scent: White VetiverVerified PurchaseI absolutely love rather loved the white Vetiver candles.  I always purchased the 32 ounce three wick or the four wick  I believe its 98 ounce I cant remejmber what size your largest candle is it goes now for $198. I have purchased this three times in the last three months.  I have also been purchasing these candles from you for about four or five years your price keeps going up; your quality keeps going down. You will lose your client base. The quality of your candles has consistently gotten worse. It is very obvious you are using the old fashion way of making your candles where theres a lot of wax around three little candles.  The last three candles I have purchased  have problems keeping the wicks lit. I just purchased a candle, and only one wick out of three works.  The candles was  $78  I do not have a problem, paying for a quality item.  Based on what I am seeing and on the number of purchases I have made which are quite a few. I consider this to be an insult to your customers.  If you were going to reduce your quality of your candles, reduce your price, I could make a better candle than the candle that I just recently purchased through Amazon, which is yours.  It is extremely upsetting to have a company like yours allow themself to reduce their quality to the point that it is right now. I hope other customers will reach out to you and make you aware of how unhappy they are with your low quality which has been since Covid.  If you cant make a quality candle, reduce your price at least by 2/3rd. These candles used to be worth the price, but the quality of your candles now, they are not worth the price.  Its better to buy your own vetiver, yes, it is expensive, and and make your own candles because then at least you know, your wicks will work and they wont be made cheaply the way that you are now making them. These are no longer high-quality candles. They are not worth the price. I am really sorry to say that because I have enjoyed these candles tremendously.  You have ruined your company. You have ruined your companys  reputation by your lack of caring about the quality and service you are providing your customers. I will also be submitting this on your website.  When I first started purchasing your candles, I gave you five stars. Youre down to one star if there was a possibility of doing zero stars that is exactly what I would give you.  Paying $78 for a candle that is a three wick candle and only one wick is works and you can obviously see there are three little candles just filled with wax around them unlike the way you used to make them.  Your customers are noticing the downward spiral. Your company is taking in quality. You will lose them.Read more24 people found this helpfulHelpfulReportEOS Decorating5.0 out of 5 starsBetter then the restReviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024Scent: CharcoalVerified PurchaseThis candle is absolutely AMAZING! I\\'ve had it for about a month and use it multiple times a week.I was stewing on this product for a long while but couldn\\'t justify the price. $80 for a candle just seems outrageous! Finally, I made the decision to purchase it here and figured at worst, I would return it. I\\'ve heard from others that the scent reminds them of a sexy man, and I must concur. It truly is an amazing smell and it covers smells from cooked food to smoke  to so on.I use this in my bedroom and only have to light it for 30 minutes to 1 hour and it completely fills up the room, enters the hallway, and master bath. I haven\\'t made a dent in the candle and I suspect it\\'ll last me 6 months or more!  For reference, the bedroom size is about 40 ft by 20 ft. In order for me to get this kind of throw I would have to light 2 to 3 candles for hours on end, speaking specifically about the most popular brands. Because of this purchase, I decided to purchase the advent calendar from their site in order to sample a lot of their other fragrances and found some gems.  Some other smells that are fantastic are Earl Grey Bitters and Hinoki Lavender in their candle and reed diffusers.Their products definitely costs more then any other company I\\'ve seen but the quality is second to none.  They\\'re legit when they talk about the amount of fragrance oils, quality of the candles base, vessel, and so on.  As I\\'m writing this review I\\'m subscribing to another scent,  Earl Grey Bitters in the large 3 wick candle. This size candle is one of their better values if you enjoy the scent.Read more2 people found this helpfulHelpfulReportmihaela birca2.0 out of 5 starsNot worth the priceReviewed in the United States on February 16, 2024Scent: White VetiverVerified PurchaseThe candle looks great and the packaging was nice, but almost no scent.
